    "Current technological advances make possible both unprecented economies of scale and scope and the exact matching of supply and demand for labour and skills. These advances would in theory allow firms to significantly reduce overhead on non-productive employees, at the same time creating more meaningful work opportunities for workers. However, given difficulties involved in building up buffers for workers specializing in less in-demand activities, the gig economy currently disproportionally benefits highly skilled workers. Unfortunately, these workers only constitute a small percentage of the total workforce of a country. As a result, the same technologies that enable unprecented economies of scale and scope at the level of the individual worker therefore also work to aggravate existing economic inequalities across the workforce, perpetuating a cycle of privilege and access to education inherent in the socio-economic fabric of our early 21st-century world. Solutions such as universal basic income (UBI) fail to take into account the positive psychological, social, societal and health benifits of individuals participating in and contributing to a community. In the inverse sense, increasing the economic value of the population provides a buffer and leverage against any exclusivist tendencies or policies developed by the most powerful economic and political actors. Where in the last three hundred-fifty years (roughly 1650 CE to 1990 CE) the nation-state had a powerful military incentive to improve the education levels of the workforce and national economy, at the beginning of the 21st century these incentives appear of limited value given the global challenges mankind faces. In fact, the incentivization schemes being maintained at the national level are counterproductive or even damaging when it come to tackling issues such as climate change, epidemic diseases, resource scarcity, poverty reduction, economic development, and the protection of the earth ecosystem. What I argue in this paper is that break is needed from economic the paradigm put forward in it's most clear form in Adam Smith's *The Wealth of Nations* (1776 CE), and the construction of a new social contract, which I will refer to as *the advancement of mankind*.\n",

    "Of course merely changing conversation themes and discussion points in political discourse in itself won't change the world economic outlook. However, framing the political discourse and greater good along global lines rather than national borders and national identities should - over time - help force politicians and the general public away from the currents of misplaced bigotry, tribalism, and nepotism still all too common in today's world. Progress as a rallying cry has of course been used and abused throughout history, so a clear definition of what is meant by human development is merited. \n",
